# Hello Hackers
## Command history
You're going to type a lot of commands, and typing everything from scratch can be annoying. Luckily, the shell saves a history of every command you invoke.
You can scroll through those saved commands with the up/down arrow keys, and we'll practice that in this challenge. This challenge will inject the flag into your history. 
Bring up a terminal, hit the up arrow, and grab it! In other challenges, the history will contain the log of the commands you've run, so if you need to run a similar 
command again, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through and find it!

### Solve
**Flag:**  `pwn.college{U6rCti6EY5-Q9Z1v6UJN_A7-Mpk.0lNzEzNxwiN1gjNzEzW}`
```
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{U6rCti6EY5-Q9Z1v6UJN_A7-Mpk.0lNzEzNxwiN1gjNzEzW}
```
According to the description, the arrow keys had to be used to execute previously executed commands without having to type them again,  thus the 'up' arrow key was used to find the flag.

### New Learnings
I learnt how to execute similar commands without having to type them again and thus save time in doing so.
